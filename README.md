## Revature Bench Mini-project 

This mini-project was served to reinforce my skillset in the Java Streams API. 
It is a Spring Boot project which uses the embedded H2 memory to load predefined data to query data from a relational database model using a REST controller.
Spring Data JPA is used to learn a different version of querying apart from NoSQL/Cassandra.
